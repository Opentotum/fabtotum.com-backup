		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I hope you can make this happen, I really want one. I suggest while the design is evolving that you make it so the scanner portion can be mounted outside of the work envelope so that items larger items can be scanned, (like the side of a car, or someone&#039;s head) Mount the scanner on the indexing turntable and sweep across the subject surface. This would add a great many possibilities to what can be brought into the software environment for manipulation or creating small parts that fit onto the big real world part.
Best wishes,
Martin Cooper]]></description>
