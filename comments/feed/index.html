		<description><![CDATA[So if I want to print something at 200°C, I should set the temperature in the slicer to 210°C. And the printer will then show 210°C, but the nozzle will actually only be 200°C. Is that correct?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi
Please read carefully the specs and the description over to IGG.
The coolant in the &quot;making of&quot; is on a machining done to build the fabtotum itself.that is another CNC machine alltogether.
FABtotum has no built-in coolant system.

Also, it&#039;s not capable of heavy machining.
Print and mill is possible only in certain situations, but it&#039;s an advanced usage of the machine. Software to manage both the types of machining is still missing from the scene.
You can use FABtotum to cut and mill light woods like balsa or plywood but yo can&#039;t cut deep aluminium or steel.

the power supply will be 120v/240v compatible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I didn&#039;t notice a &quot;contact&quot; email so I&#039;m asking here.
I noticed in one of the videos that you use coolant, so we can assume that the enclosure is water tight to some degree.
And if we are using coolant how hard is it to clean the inside of the work area?
Are the motors coolant resistant or located well away from where chips and coolant could get to them?
Are the scanning elements removable or do they just get wet?
And cleaned before use?
Can you 3D print with coolant in the work area?
Can you print and mill alternatively say for a production job? In the same program?
Can you leave the print on the build bed and move it to another machine to do more subsequent operations?
120 Volts for the United States? Or voltage converter required.
So scan, remove program, load into another program, reload back onto the machine and then machine. Can this all be handled by the non-supplied computer easily? Or are there other considerations? 
Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
I hope you can make this happen, I really want one. I suggest while the design is evolving that you make it so the scanner portion can be mounted outside of the work envelope so that items larger items can be scanned, (like the side of a car, or someone&#039;s head) Mount the scanner on the indexing turntable and sweep across the subject surface. This would add a great many possibilities to what can be brought into the software environment for manipulation or creating small parts that fit onto the big real world part.
Best wishes,
Martin Cooper]]></description>
