<p>After a while we are finally back with some great news: we worked hard during this last months and we focused, in particular, on the changes outlined on the <a href="http://forum.fabtotum.cc/showthread.php?1788-WIP-development-document&amp;p=7723#post7723" target="_blank">development document</a>.<br />
The development document is basically a text that sums up all user experiences and weaknesses of the FABtotum platform. We acknowledged and adressed each one of them, in the spirit of transparency and improving the user experience and the platform with it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/users.png"><img class="img-responsive aligncenter" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/users-1024x226.png" alt="users" width="625" height="138" /></a><br />
We are now glad to announce the changes you are going to see and how those will affect the current userbase.<br />
When we closed our Crowdfunding campaign we definitely aimed high, and we are proud of that. We surpassed the original goals and stretch goals. With the same spirit, the way we are improving the FABtotum today is a testimony of our commitment to the platform.</p>
<p>With the campaign deliveries completed a few months ago, we are now ready to push the envelope even further.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware Improvements</strong></p>
<p>First of all:  fear not, we will not make a &#8220;new&#8221; version of the FABtotum, but we are introducing a series of changes starting from this week.  New purchased units will be delivered with the new updates, <em>availables from october</em> for free.<br />
We won&#8217;t be able, sadly, to provide free upgraded replacements to older users, but we designed them to be 100% retrocompatible and DIY friendly.<br />
This means older units will require a couple of DIY tweaks to get up to date.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prod.png"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prod-1024x569.png" alt="prod" width="625" height="347" /></a></p>
<p>Lets look at the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified Feeder Mechanism (no need to engage or disengage from now on)</li>
<li>New Bowden system. Better feeding and solved the &#8220;tube getting caught&#8221; issue.</li>
<li>A Reed Sensor in place of the front door mechanical endstop.</li>
<li>New Heated bed electronics: easier placement, faster heating times, higher temps.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear: most of the above can be achieved with simple DIY mods.<br />
Upgrades that improve specs (e.g: newer heated bed) can be purchased separately and are retrocompatible.<br />
Guides on our wiki will guide you thought the upgrading process regardless of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>Software improvements</strong><br />
Software will run across all FABtotum like always. You can expect the following improvements in the next few updates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scanning update! Sweeping and Rotative scan have been reworked.Photogrammetry is being added (will require third party free SFM software), making textured scans <a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sfm_post1.jpg" target="_blank">like this </a>possible. With this upcoming update perspective and camera distortions can be balanced and stitching of multiple point clouds will be possible and easier.</li>
<li>Network-based postprocessing (use your computer for complex tasks (e.g. slicing and reconstruction) is coming.</li>
<li>V1.0: Colibri FAB UI, the embedded OS with onboard failsafe recovery. From FABUI 1.0 the older OS will be discarded and development will continue on the Colibri FAB UI distro. All units will be able to upgrade by downloading and flashing the OS image to their FABtotum SD cards.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heads up! Introducing the hybrid Head V2.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>3D printing world is growing and lots of new filaments are now available: when we developed our first head we could never guess this would be that fast! So now we are eager to see you printing at <em>higher temperatures, with different materials and with the best quality</em> ever reached.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cutout-Render-New-Hot-End.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cutout-Render-New-Hot-End.jpg" alt="Cutout Render - New Hot End" width="403" height="302" /></a></p>
<p>We are still refining our job but we can already introduce you some of the improvements of the new FABtotum&#8217;s hybrid head, capable of 3D printing and Milling/Engraving.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will be <em>totally serviceable</em>: we heard you! Maintenance and repairs will be much easier from now on! No more stress when cleaning or unclogging; every 3D printer owner is used to this kind of troubles and we think this is the right choice.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a <em>full metal body</em>, with a 6mm PTFE Liner. More reliable, stronger and&#8230; well, it looks cool.</li>
<li>It has an <em>inox steel melting chamber,</em> with heatbreak to stop thermal flow to the head. This, again, will get you a more resistant head, which will endure longer and will stay clean and safe from damages.</li>
<li>Along with this last thing, the Hybrid Head V2 will have an <em>aluminium heat sink</em> to cooldown the body and PTFE liner. Nothing melts, nothing gets ruined, the head preserve itself.</li>
<li><em>Brass nozzles will be interchangeables</em>! With a 0.4mm mounted on as standard, we will give you the chance to take it off and screw in another one. We are still deciding the other sizes: in our minds we have a 0.3, 0.5 and 0.8mm range. Have you got any special wish? This is your chance to tell us what would be best for your needings!</li>
<li>It will reach higher temperatures: the FABtotum is built around flexibility. Many filaments require a wider range of temperatures despite the usual 180-230°C of our original hybrid head. O<em>ur new hybrid head will reach 250°-260°</em> (in continuos operation with fan always on). This opens up a wide range of new filaments and possibilities. While you will of course be able to print PLA, ABS and PETG easily, we are going to try NYLON, HIPS and PC. Also: improved cooling.</li>
<li>There are news on the milling side as well. The new FABtotum&#8217;s hybrid head (and to be honest all the hybrid heads delivered from May 2015) features a smoother, quieter milling motor thanks to a new balanced shaft design.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150429_095331.jpg"><img class="img-responsive aligncenter" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150429_095331-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_20150429_095331" width="466" height="350" /></a><em>Hybrid head v2 first Prototype (note: the milling motor was not mounted in this unit)</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s quite a lot, don&#8217;t you think? FABtotum&#8217;s hybrid head V2 will be a sensible improvement expecially for new 3D printing users, that have experienced the most issues to date due to the unforgiving working parameters of the Hybrid head V1 setup. The good thing is, also, that who already owns a FABtotum just needs to get a separate head and start playing again. No need to buy another printer, no need for extra space on the desk.</p>
<p><strong>The new FABtotum&#8217;s hybrid head V2 will be available from October: you can already buy it with a pre-order discount <a href="https://store.fabtotum.com/intl/store/hybrid-head-v2-hyb.html" target="_blank">on our store</a></strong></p>
<p><em><a href="https://store.fabtotum.com" target="_blank">Y</a>ou can choose between a <strong>full Hybrid Head</strong> and a <strong>Printing only</strong> version, designed for customers who already owns a V1 head and doesn&#8217;t need another milling motor!</em></p>
<p><strong>Upgrading existing orders:<br />
</strong>The ones who are still in the pending line should have received an email already (should you not please write us): everyone from their order page is able to switch to the upgraded version of the FABtotum!<strong><br />
</strong>What <strong>if you still need to order it</strong>? Until <strong>September</strong> you will be able to buy it with the current pre-order discount! <strong>New orders</strong> from today, of course, <strong>will include the new hybrid head</strong> and all the changes listed above.</p>
