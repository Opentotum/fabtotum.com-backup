we&#8217;re ready to share another story with you.<br />
In these days many things are coming up, from events (<a href="https://www.fabtotum.com/events-calendar/">have a look at our agenda</a>!) to national holidays. But <strong>Giovanni Mancino</strong>, the protagonist of this Community Highlight, has so many projects alive he barely manage to get everything done right on time.</p>
<p>He has a small business starting up and here are a few ideas that came out of his FABtotum that will get him right where the people need him.<br />
He has been using the FABtotum Personal Fabricator with an Hybrid Head and he got skilled little by little. Today he is pro user!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Juventus Clock</strong><br />
Hard task for a guy who is an Inter FC supporter. You know italians are crazy for football. It was not too hard for the FABtotum though! This was one of his first tasks and was a gift for a friend.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-118051" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scudetto-juventus-stampa-3d.jpg" alt="" width="950" height="653" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scudetto-juventus-stampa-3d.jpg 1600w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scudetto-juventus-stampa-3d-300x206.jpg 300w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scudetto-juventus-stampa-3d-768x528.jpg 768w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scudetto-juventus-stampa-3d-1030x708.jpg 1030w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scudetto-juventus-stampa-3d-1500x1031.jpg 1500w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scudetto-juventus-stampa-3d-705x485.jpg 705w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/scudetto-juventus-stampa-3d-450x309.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what it took:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 hours of modeling;</li>
<li>14 hours of printing;</li>
<li>0.5 hours to get everything together and sand off where he got too far with tolerances (we all know how disturbing tolerances can be, right?)</li>
</ul>
<p>He used the colors of the team (black and white) and then designed a pink stand composed by two polygons forming the ball (the hexagon and the pentagon). The color represents the very first uniform, which had a pink t-shirt. As you can see from the pictures, he then needed to mount the motor and make the clock functioning. We&#8217;ll show you the picture of another clock he made just to get you an idea on how he could do this. So yes, he can 3D print clocks. Amazing right? But that&#8217;s not all!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-118052" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-clock.jpg" alt="" width="427" height="500" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-clock.jpg 3120w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-clock-256x300.jpg 256w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-clock-768x900.jpg 768w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-clock-879x1030.jpg 879w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-clock-1280x1500.jpg 1280w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-clock-602x705.jpg 602w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-clock-450x527.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here you have the final look, of course it is completely functioning!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-118057" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/orologio-juventus_stampa-3d.jpg" alt="" width="712" height="949" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/orologio-juventus_stampa-3d.jpg 1200w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/orologio-juventus_stampa-3d-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/orologio-juventus_stampa-3d-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/orologio-juventus_stampa-3d-773x1030.jpg 773w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/orologio-juventus_stampa-3d-1125x1500.jpg 1125w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/orologio-juventus_stampa-3d-529x705.jpg 529w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/orologio-juventus_stampa-3d-450x600.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 712px) 100vw, 712px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Trumphets set</strong><br />
Here in Italy we normally give a small item as gift/souvenir for the special events. Everything is a good reason: from births to anniversaries, weddings, graduations, licences&#8230; just everything.<br />
Giovanni made these cute trumphets for a guy who got his conservatory graduation in&#8230;well, that&#8217;s obvious, right?<br />
Here is what it took:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.30 hours of modeling;</li>
<li>3 hours of printing;</li>
<li>7.50 hours of post processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading the numbers it is easy to understand that the hardest part was the latest. Easy to shape, easy to print&#8230;with lots of <strong>supports</strong>. As you may know, supports are the materials printed to preserve quality when angles and curves can be too difficult. The extras will sustain the final object so that nothing gets damaged or of poor quality. Supports then need to be scratched off gently. Depending on the used slicing software, they can be different in thickness, shape, and distance from the object. They need to be carefully set, otherwise they can be useless or, in the worst scenario, they can even damage the print.<br />
Giovanni <em>used a scalpel</em> to make sure that all the small 3D printed trumpeths were nice in their gold PLA structure.<br />
We really love the final result (and we can barely think of him trying not to get crazy while removing all the supports, considering it took a whole night until 6am)! Detailed, shiny, cute: they&#8217;re perfect to celebrate a graduation!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-118053" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-trumphets.jpg" alt="" width="950" height="670" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-trumphets.jpg 1556w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-trumphets-300x212.jpg 300w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-trumphets-768x542.jpg 768w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-trumphets-1030x727.jpg 1030w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-trumphets-1500x1058.jpg 1500w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-trumphets-705x497.jpg 705w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/3D-printed-trumphets-450x318.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, congratulation to the trumphet player but to Giovanni as well! He will soon have a Facebook page, we&#8217;ll share the link as soon as available.</p>
<p>If you want to contact him, tell us, we&#8217;ll do the trick for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for today,<br />

<p>these days have seen the <a href="https://www.fabtotum.com/3d-printers/heads/3d-laser-printer/">Laser Head</a> coming out on the store and quickly disappear again as you got them all in an hour or so. While we <em>thank you</em> once again for your overwhelming welcome, we still love the idea that with the FABtotum you can Make More.<br />
Today with a new Community post, we&#8217;d love to introduce you <strong>Sinan</strong>, aka <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kralmarks/">kralmarks</a> on Instagram. He knows how small things can become great ones. He lives in Istanbul, Turkey, and he is quite new among us: his one is a <a href="https://www.fabtotum.com/3d-printers/fabtotum-personal-fabricator/"><strong>FABtotum CORE</strong></a> and he&#8217;s been using it quite intensively. The project we&#8217;ll write you about is the first one he shares with us: we are sure we&#8217;ll read from him again anyway!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sinan needed a great gift idea: 3D printing helped him and got him a solution: he therefore started designing <strong>a fully working carousel</strong>. It spins! It took a while to get the whole thing done but surely it will be appreciated. So, let&#8217;s see what he did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117354" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3d-design-toy1.jpg" alt="3d-design-toy" width="1176" height="747" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3d-design-toy1.jpg 1176w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3d-design-toy1-300x191.jpg 300w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3d-design-toy1-768x488.jpg 768w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3d-design-toy1-1030x654.jpg 1030w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3d-design-toy1-705x448.jpg 705w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3d-design-toy1-450x286.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 1176px) 100vw, 1176px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>From nothing to digital</strong><br />
Sinan designed himself all the parts with the help of one of the most common 3D designing software. It took over a week to have all the components ready and as far as we know he could even add more timing to the final count as he still thought something was missing. The number of parts is about 50: many of them are unique pieces while smaller ones might be reprinted more than once.</p>
<p>He then had to make all the gcodes done. Until here, we&#8217;re still digital. Let&#8217;s see how he got his idea to real.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117360" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3dprinting-toy-fabtotum.jpg" alt="3dprinting toy - fabtotum" width="618" height="430" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3dprinting-toy-fabtotum.jpg 618w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3dprinting-toy-fabtotum-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3dprinting-toy-fabtotum-450x313.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 618px) 100vw, 618px" /></p>
<p><strong>From digital to real</strong><br />
Once all the gcodes were correctly uploaded on the FABUI, the FABtotum User Interface you all should know quite good, he could start the 3D printing process. He used a light blue PLA filament for everything except the top. Could he change the colour at a random point to get a multicolor 3D printing? Maybe, ask him! He did not tell us why he picked this colour but we find the project itself is still so goodlooking that we did not even think of asking more. Also, the yellow top adds the missing contrast so we still love how it looks.</p>
<p>The total timing for 3D printing all of the small parts? 75 hours. Yep, the FABtotum has been printing for around three days. Stressing but nothing went wrong!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117356" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3d-printed-carousel.jpg" alt="3d printed carousel" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3d-printed-carousel.jpg 720w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3d-printed-carousel-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3d-printed-carousel-705x397.jpg 705w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3d-printed-carousel-450x253.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>From pieces to final goal</strong><br />
The final step has been the toughest one: assembling all the small parts. Once he had everything on the table he then got the help of toothpicks and glue. He of course had a very clear view of the final look as he had to stick them so that they could still be free to move and spin.<br />
You may want to know how long it took to have everything done: <strong>20 hours</strong>. To be added to the previous ones of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117358" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3dprinted-toy.jpg" alt="3dprinted toy" width="640" height="552" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3dprinted-toy.jpg 640w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3dprinted-toy-300x259.jpg 300w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/3dprinted-toy-450x388.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>So, it took a while but the gift is ready: surely the person who this project is for will appreciate both the idea and the efforts behind it. And you? Did you like it? Want to get one as well? Contact Sinan to know more!<br />
