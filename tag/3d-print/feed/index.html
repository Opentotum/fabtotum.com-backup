As we truly believe in it, we thought that our <a href="https://www.fabtotum.com/community/">community</a> deserved to be highlighted. Many of our customers have been sharing with us their jobs: it is a source of pride for us to show you all of them and surely a source of inspiration for all of you.</p>
<p>So: from today on we will dedicate a post to our best users on a weekly basis.<br />
Want to be one of them? <a href="mailto:info@fabtotum.com">Share with us your results</a>, we&#8217;ll do our best to get them all published!<br />
And don&#8217;t forget our social accounts: using them will get your objects straight onto the FABUI dashboard.<br />
Today&#8217;s protagonist is: Angelo D&#8217;Angelo, aka <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnytrapano">@Johnnytrapano</a>!<br />
Our fellow has been using his FABtotum for a while now and many things have been created with it. Lately he stepped even further and developed a script than enables <strong>multicolor 3D printing on the FABtotum</strong>. Yes, really! He named it <em>CFOG</em> (Change Filament On the Go).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-116185" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3dprinting-fabtotum-multicolor.jpg" alt="3dprinting-fabtotum-multicolor" width="600" height="389" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3dprinting-fabtotum-multicolor.jpg 1200w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3dprinting-fabtotum-multicolor-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3dprinting-fabtotum-multicolor-768x498.jpg 768w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3dprinting-fabtotum-multicolor-1030x668.jpg 1030w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3dprinting-fabtotum-multicolor-705x457.jpg 705w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/3dprinting-fabtotum-multicolor-450x292.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How is it possible? Here is what he did, briefly.</strong><br />
He developed a gcode which has to be added where needed between the lines. It allows to pause the task, quickly change the filament and start again. It is possible to just switch the color or even choose a different material.<br />
The CFOG gets your print layered in as many different kind of shades as you want: of course the layers only allow the texture to be horizontal, but it is a great starting point.</p>
<p><strong>How to use it?</strong><br />
That&#8217;s pretty simple actually. Just fit the portion of code where you want to change the color: the print will automatically pause, unload filament and wait you for load the new one</p>
<p>Here below you&#8217;ll find some detailed instructions to use the CFOG script. If you need more information, you can write him anytime. Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CFOG.txt?utm_source=bl&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_campaign=ch">download it here</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your stl file in your preferred slicing software, Cura will do.</li>
<li>Set the print as usual, using our settings and tuning them according to your FABtotum.</li>
<li>Save the gcode as usual.</li>
<li>Open the gcode file and decide where you want to switch the filament. Every layer is well mentioned in the file, so you just have to get there and paste the CFOG code.<br />
Notice: Cura starts from layer “0” in the file but starts from layer “1” when visualizing the same one into the software. This means you&#8217;ll have to count down a layer to get the right one.</li>
<li>If something is required to be set or done during the whole job, you&#8217;ll find it in the code, highlighted with three “!” symbols.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Additional settings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Look for the last line starting with the command “G1” and copy it in the CFOG, just where needed (see below). Also: decrease the “E” value by 7: this will unload 7mm of filament from the hotend.<img class="size-full wp-image-116168 aligncenter" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/multicolor-3D-printing-FABtotum.png" alt="multicolor-3d-printing-fabtotum" width="581" height="106" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/multicolor-3D-printing-FABtotum.png 581w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/multicolor-3D-printing-FABtotum-300x55.png 300w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/multicolor-3D-printing-FABtotum-450x82.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px" /></li>
<li>Make always sure to set a Z value higher than the Z layer height where you use the CFOG.<br />
This is where you need to do this:<br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-116170 aligncenter" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CFOG-Multicolor-3D-prints.png" alt="cfog-multicolor-3d-prints" width="472" height="96" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CFOG-Multicolor-3D-prints.png 472w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CFOG-Multicolor-3D-prints-300x61.png 300w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/CFOG-Multicolor-3D-prints-450x92.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px" /></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Look up for the code below in the script: at this same line you need to change the “E” value with the first one you can find after the CFOG one. This will make sure that anything we changed turns back at the original gcode settings. Here is where to proceed:</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-116172 aligncenter" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gcode-multicolor-FABtotum.png" alt="gcode-multicolor-fabtotum" width="578" height="42" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gcode-multicolor-FABtotum.png 578w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gcode-multicolor-FABtotum-300x22.png 300w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/gcode-multicolor-FABtotum-450x33.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 578px) 100vw, 578px" /></p>
<p>Once you get here, you are ready to save the file, get it on the FABtotum and print.<br />
Of course, you&#8217;ll need to stand next to your 3D printer to be ready and switch color/material. Beeps from the FABtotum will alert you when it&#8217;s time to hurry up and operate. Make always sure to get rid of excess filament.<br />
One last thing, as Johnnytrapano says on his blog post: if you need to change the printing temperatures, remember to do so by removing the “;” symbol from the right line and set the new value.</p>

<p>After a short break we are already back with some updates for you. Expect more in the near future, you&#8217;ll hear from us again really soon.<br />
In the meantime we can tell you that, after two years from the start and one of production/deliveries, we have a bunch of new things that will be available in the upcoming days.</p>
<p><strong>The Hybrid Head V2</strong><br />
We told you in the<a href="http://blog.fabtotum.com/blog/2015/07/21/fabtotum-is-getting-upgraded/" target="_blank"> previous post</a> that the Hybrid Head V2 is on its way: we&#8217;re not done yet with it though: we are still working on the last details; the final result will offer you the best performances ever and a better quality of prints.<br />
While waiting for some smaller parts to be delivered and tested, we are already watching it printing fine objects.<br />
In the picture below you can see some samples that show you the improvements: higher temperatures let us try different materials and we can proudly tell you we can print PLA, ABS and NYLON.</p>
<div style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter center"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_headv2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Samples of prints with the Hybrid Head V2" width="625" height="417" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><i>Samples of prints with the Hybrid Head V2</i></p></div>
<p>The specs are the ones previously released but we take the chance to sum them up:</p>
<ul>
<li>full metal body hotend;</li>
<li>improved fans system;</li>
<li>completely interchangeable nozzle (which means easier maintenance/replacing);</li>
<li>completely interchangeable cartridge;</li>
<li>different nozzle sizes available (we will tell you more later on);</li>
<li>260° max working temperature.</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/FABtotum_HHV2-1024x633.jpg" alt="First pictures of the Hybrid Head V2: final look may still change" width="625" height="386" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><i>First pictures of the Hybrid Head V2: final look may still change</i></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A new Feeder</strong><br />
The feeder mechanism has now become simpler and does not require any action to switch between additive and subtractive mode.<br />
No more buttons to be pushed: new FABtotums will have a slightly different feeder and won&#8217;t have any hole on the back inner panel.</p>
<p>What if you already have a FABtotum and want this to be available on yours as well?<br />
We will add a dedicated note on our wiki as you need to manually change it before switching to the new version from the settings of the FabUI.<br />
This is something we decided to change as a consequence of the community&#8217;s experience. That&#8217;s why, once again, we are always looking for your feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Scanning update</strong><br />
Out of the three first capabilities of the FABtotum, scanning option has always been difficult to be used. Results were not always reliable and satisfying. We worked hard on this as we wanted to offer you a better product. In the upcoming months we will focus even more to have you less stressed when postprocessing. Shapes will be less deformed, the camera is going to add colours and details to the final result. We will tell you more as soon as we have news and we will always update our <a href="http://forum.fabtotum.cc/forumdisplay.php?9-Development-Logs" target="_blank">development log on the forum</a> as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A more complete Wiki</strong><br />
First year of FABtotum&#8217;s life also gave us a better idea of which were the main obstacles between a bad print and a good one: 3d printing can require a bit of knowledge first and our machine as well need to be “discovered”.</p>
<p>To help you (and to help us as well) we are little by little completing the wiki: a lot of new contents have been added every now and then and still are. Our Team together with the community increased the literature available online so that troubleshooting and first steps became easier.<br />
<a href="http://wiki.fabtotum.com/doku.php?id=start" target="_blank">You can give it a look and find out yourself here</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fabtotum_assembly-1024x480.png" alt="An idea of all the components of the FABtotum" width="625" height="293" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><i>An idea of all the components of the FABtotum</i></p></div>
<p><strong>All the documents are now on GitHub</strong><br />
We have gone even further than that: loyal to our Open Source identity, on Git Hub we added every missing specification. From hardware (<a href="https://grabcad.com/library/fabtotum-2" target="_blank">already available on GrabCAD</a>) to software, everyone can see what the FABtotum is made of and how it works. Suggestions are appreciated, simple curiosity is also welcome.<br />
<a href="http://wiki.fabtotum.com/doku.php?id=open_source" target="_blank">Here is where you can find everything</a></p>
<p><strong>Laser Head</strong><br />
It has been in our projects since the beginning and it is now pretty much ready. We are still testing it, but the first results have seen our smiles rising and shining on our faces. It is not mentioned to cut hard and thick materials: we still prefer to leave this kind of job to the milling motor. Now you can throw away that smelly mutated seabass of yours.<br />
With the laser head of the FABtotum you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>engrave woods, plastics etc;</li>
<li>cut thin sheets of paper, cardboard and plastic.</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot:</p>
<ul>
<li>cut thick plastics or other thick materials (&gt;0.2mm)</li>
<li>pretend to be an evil scientist.</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/laser_rid-e1439981003659.png" alt="Testing the laser precision and quality" width="625" height="356" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><i>Testing the laser precision and quality</i></p></div>
<p>The new head won&#8217;t replicate the capability of the milling head. However, as you may know, laser engraving has a much more higher precision. You will be able to write or draw lines on the mentioned materials, as well as cut what would be too soft of thin for a drill bit.<br />
The power of the laser we will use is <strong>500 mW</strong>: nothing too powerful, just enough to do what&#8217;s needed.<br />
This means that it won&#8217;t be too dangerous or require special equipments, but it will still be better to use a bit of extra care when turned on.<br />
This is how it will look like, more or less:</p>
<div style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4465_laser-rid.jpg" alt="First pictures of the Laser Head - final look may be slightly different" width="625" height="417" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><i> First pictures of the Laser Head &#8211; final look may be slightly different</i></p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><br />
</em>It will be easy to be mounted on the FABtotum and won&#8217;t require extra calibrations in addition to the ones you would normally do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Coming soon&#8230;</strong><br />
Today, then, we can say we already pushed the envelope a bit further than the first idea of FABtotum, born two years ago on Indiegogo.</p>
<div style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/three-heads-rid.jpg" alt="The three Heads: the V1, the V2 and the Laser Head" width="625" height="355" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><i> The three Heads: the V1, the V2 and the Laser Head</i></p></div>
<p>But, as said at the very beginning of this post, we still have other great news coming soon&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive aligncenter" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/teaser.png" alt="teaser" width="600" height="640" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Keep following us!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>*Available from next release, due on 20th August.</em></p>

<p>After a while we are finally back with some great news: we worked hard during this last months and we focused, in particular, on the changes outlined on the <a href="http://forum.fabtotum.cc/showthread.php?1788-WIP-development-document&amp;p=7723#post7723" target="_blank">development document</a>.<br />
The development document is basically a text that sums up all user experiences and weaknesses of the FABtotum platform. We acknowledged and adressed each one of them, in the spirit of transparency and improving the user experience and the platform with it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/users.png"><img class="img-responsive aligncenter" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/users-1024x226.png" alt="users" width="625" height="138" /></a><br />
We are now glad to announce the changes you are going to see and how those will affect the current userbase.<br />
When we closed our Crowdfunding campaign we definitely aimed high, and we are proud of that. We surpassed the original goals and stretch goals. With the same spirit, the way we are improving the FABtotum today is a testimony of our commitment to the platform.</p>
<p>With the campaign deliveries completed a few months ago, we are now ready to push the envelope even further.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware Improvements</strong></p>
<p>First of all:  fear not, we will not make a &#8220;new&#8221; version of the FABtotum, but we are introducing a series of changes starting from this week.  New purchased units will be delivered with the new updates, <em>availables from october</em> for free.<br />
We won&#8217;t be able, sadly, to provide free upgraded replacements to older users, but we designed them to be 100% retrocompatible and DIY friendly.<br />
This means older units will require a couple of DIY tweaks to get up to date.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prod.png"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/prod-1024x569.png" alt="prod" width="625" height="347" /></a></p>
<p>Lets look at the changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified Feeder Mechanism (no need to engage or disengage from now on)</li>
<li>New Bowden system. Better feeding and solved the &#8220;tube getting caught&#8221; issue.</li>
<li>A Reed Sensor in place of the front door mechanical endstop.</li>
<li>New Heated bed electronics: easier placement, faster heating times, higher temps.</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear: most of the above can be achieved with simple DIY mods.<br />
Upgrades that improve specs (e.g: newer heated bed) can be purchased separately and are retrocompatible.<br />
Guides on our wiki will guide you thought the upgrading process regardless of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>Software improvements</strong><br />
Software will run across all FABtotum like always. You can expect the following improvements in the next few updates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Scanning update! Sweeping and Rotative scan have been reworked.Photogrammetry is being added (will require third party free SFM software), making textured scans <a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sfm_post1.jpg" target="_blank">like this </a>possible. With this upcoming update perspective and camera distortions can be balanced and stitching of multiple point clouds will be possible and easier.</li>
<li>Network-based postprocessing (use your computer for complex tasks (e.g. slicing and reconstruction) is coming.</li>
<li>V1.0: Colibri FAB UI, the embedded OS with onboard failsafe recovery. From FABUI 1.0 the older OS will be discarded and development will continue on the Colibri FAB UI distro. All units will be able to upgrade by downloading and flashing the OS image to their FABtotum SD cards.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Heads up! Introducing the hybrid Head V2.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>3D printing world is growing and lots of new filaments are now available: when we developed our first head we could never guess this would be that fast! So now we are eager to see you printing at <em>higher temperatures, with different materials and with the best quality</em> ever reached.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cutout-Render-New-Hot-End.jpg"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Cutout-Render-New-Hot-End.jpg" alt="Cutout Render - New Hot End" width="403" height="302" /></a></p>
<p>We are still refining our job but we can already introduce you some of the improvements of the new FABtotum&#8217;s hybrid head, capable of 3D printing and Milling/Engraving.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will be <em>totally serviceable</em>: we heard you! Maintenance and repairs will be much easier from now on! No more stress when cleaning or unclogging; every 3D printer owner is used to this kind of troubles and we think this is the right choice.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a <em>full metal body</em>, with a 6mm PTFE Liner. More reliable, stronger and&#8230; well, it looks cool.</li>
<li>It has an <em>inox steel melting chamber,</em> with heatbreak to stop thermal flow to the head. This, again, will get you a more resistant head, which will endure longer and will stay clean and safe from damages.</li>
<li>Along with this last thing, the Hybrid Head V2 will have an <em>aluminium heat sink</em> to cooldown the body and PTFE liner. Nothing melts, nothing gets ruined, the head preserve itself.</li>
<li><em>Brass nozzles will be interchangeables</em>! With a 0.4mm mounted on as standard, we will give you the chance to take it off and screw in another one. We are still deciding the other sizes: in our minds we have a 0.3, 0.5 and 0.8mm range. Have you got any special wish? This is your chance to tell us what would be best for your needings!</li>
<li>It will reach higher temperatures: the FABtotum is built around flexibility. Many filaments require a wider range of temperatures despite the usual 180-230°C of our original hybrid head. O<em>ur new hybrid head will reach 250°-260°</em> (in continuos operation with fan always on). This opens up a wide range of new filaments and possibilities. While you will of course be able to print PLA, ABS and PETG easily, we are going to try NYLON, HIPS and PC. Also: improved cooling.</li>
<li>There are news on the milling side as well. The new FABtotum&#8217;s hybrid head (and to be honest all the hybrid heads delivered from May 2015) features a smoother, quieter milling motor thanks to a new balanced shaft design.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150429_095331.jpg"><img class="img-responsive aligncenter" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/IMG_20150429_095331-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_20150429_095331" width="466" height="350" /></a><em>Hybrid head v2 first Prototype (note: the milling motor was not mounted in this unit)</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s quite a lot, don&#8217;t you think? FABtotum&#8217;s hybrid head V2 will be a sensible improvement expecially for new 3D printing users, that have experienced the most issues to date due to the unforgiving working parameters of the Hybrid head V1 setup. The good thing is, also, that who already owns a FABtotum just needs to get a separate head and start playing again. No need to buy another printer, no need for extra space on the desk.</p>
<p><strong>The new FABtotum&#8217;s hybrid head V2 will be available from October: you can already buy it with a pre-order discount <a href="https://store.fabtotum.com/intl/store/hybrid-head-v2-hyb.html" target="_blank">on our store</a></strong></p>
<p><em><a href="https://store.fabtotum.com" target="_blank">Y</a>ou can choose between a <strong>full Hybrid Head</strong> and a <strong>Printing only</strong> version, designed for customers who already owns a V1 head and doesn&#8217;t need another milling motor!</em></p>
<p><strong>Upgrading existing orders:<br />
</strong>The ones who are still in the pending line should have received an email already (should you not please write us): everyone from their order page is able to switch to the upgraded version of the FABtotum!<strong><br />
</strong>What <strong>if you still need to order it</strong>? Until <strong>September</strong> you will be able to buy it with the current pre-order discount! <strong>New orders</strong> from today, of course, <strong>will include the new hybrid head</strong> and all the changes listed above.</p>

<p><em>First pictures of the Hybrid Head V2: final look may still change.</em></p>
<p><strong>Your feedback has guided us. Keep it coming.</strong></p>
<p>All the above, from day one, is a direct result of the engagement of the community with this project. We won&#8217;t be here without you in the first place!<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div></div><p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/survival_kit.jpg"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/survival_kit.jpg" alt="survival_kit" width="625" height="464" /></a></p>
<p>Hi Guys!<br />
Today we release a first batch of printable designs that are very usefull to all FABtotum users.<br />
These replicable parts will soon be pre-loaded on all units and licensed as CC-BY-SA.<br />
Along with those a new open source repository has been created to keep the slicing configuration binaries (and possibly other applications ) up to date.<br />
<strong>Slicer and Cura profiles<br />
</strong>You can find all configurations avaiable for the Slic3r and Cura Softwares on our <a href="https://github.com/FABtotum/FAB_Configs" target="_blank">FAB_configs Github repository.<br />
</a>Instructions on how to use them and what they do are available on <a href="http://wiki.fabtotum.com" target="_blank">our wiki</a><br />
These profiles (Cura Profiles in particular) have been updated and upgraded to introduce retracts, jumps and other tricks to increase quality of the prints.<br />
Feel free to send a merge request for new or improved profiles as well!<br />
On the Cura page of the Wiki you&#8217;ll find how to set up the FABtotum to print multiple models at once in sequential order.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/batchsample.jpg"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/batchsample.jpg" alt="batchsample" width="640" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Additional Replicable Components</strong><br />
Replicable componenents are meant to expand and increase usability of the FABtotum.<br />
We start off with a 4th Axis mendrel that can be mounted on top of the existing flat disc.<br />
The 4th axis mendrel can accomodate different material stocks of different sizes and shapes for machining parts<br />
on the 4th axis or hold rigid, heavy objects during the scan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4th-Axis.jpg"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4th-Axis.jpg" alt="PIMP MY FAB Assembly Instructions" width="625" height="433" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4th-Axis_0.jpg"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4th-Axis_0.jpg" alt="PIMP MY FAB Assembly Instructions" width="625" height="449" /></a><br />
The second part is a Camera Dust cover, that can be mounted to keep the camera away from machining dust.<br />
The Dust cover works with a snug snap-on fit, so it&#8217;s easy to manually remove when necessary.While a clean cloth can pretty much clean the camera (or canned air works fine) a dust cover is always useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1_camer_dust_cover.jpg"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1_camer_dust_cover.jpg" alt="PIMP MY FAB Assembly Instructions" width="625" height="437" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As some of the user reported smal particles of dust getting in to the left side panel from the endstop holes, we created a pair of clips that covers the area and limit the dust entrance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dust_lock_0.jpg"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dust_lock_0.jpg" alt="PIMP MY FAB Assembly Instructions" width="625" height="381" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dust_lock.jpg"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dust_lock.jpg" alt="PIMP MY FAB Assembly Instructions" width="625" height="341" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, an easy Spool lock-in place lever that is made to hold all spools close to 200x55mm in size <em>inside</em> the spool vane without the need of extended rollers (i.e. most of the suppliers today).<br />
just tilt the lever up and the spool will come off. gravity will hold the lever down and the spool in place during normal operations.<br />
<a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/spool_holder.jpg"><img class="img-responsive aligncenter" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/spool_holder.jpg" alt="spool_holder" width="474" height="301" /></a><br />
There are more parts available,like the spool rollers made by the community.<br />
Others will be added soon and be available for the community.<br />
You can find all FABtotum-related parts by surfing the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/FABtotum/collections/replicable-addons" target="_blank">FABtotum Replicable Addons collection </a>on Thingiverse.</p>
