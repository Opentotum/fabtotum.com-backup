<p>Hi Guys!<br />
Today we release a first batch of printable designs that are very usefull to all FABtotum users.<br />
These replicable parts will soon be pre-loaded on all units and licensed as CC-BY-SA.<br />
Along with those a new open source repository has been created to keep the slicing configuration binaries (and possibly other applications ) up to date.<br />
<strong>Slicer and Cura profiles<br />
</strong>You can find all configurations avaiable for the Slic3r and Cura Softwares on our <a href="https://github.com/FABtotum/FAB_Configs" target="_blank">FAB_configs Github repository.<br />
</a>Instructions on how to use them and what they do are available on <a href="http://wiki.fabtotum.com" target="_blank">our wiki</a><br />
These profiles (Cura Profiles in particular) have been updated and upgraded to introduce retracts, jumps and other tricks to increase quality of the prints.<br />
Feel free to send a merge request for new or improved profiles as well!<br />
On the Cura page of the Wiki you&#8217;ll find how to set up the FABtotum to print multiple models at once in sequential order.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/batchsample.jpg"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/batchsample.jpg" alt="batchsample" width="640" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Additional Replicable Components</strong><br />
Replicable componenents are meant to expand and increase usability of the FABtotum.<br />
We start off with a 4th Axis mendrel that can be mounted on top of the existing flat disc.<br />
The 4th axis mendrel can accomodate different material stocks of different sizes and shapes for machining parts<br />
on the 4th axis or hold rigid, heavy objects during the scan.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4th-Axis.jpg"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4th-Axis.jpg" alt="PIMP MY FAB Assembly Instructions" width="625" height="433" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4th-Axis_0.jpg"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4th-Axis_0.jpg" alt="PIMP MY FAB Assembly Instructions" width="625" height="449" /></a><br />
The second part is a Camera Dust cover, that can be mounted to keep the camera away from machining dust.<br />
The Dust cover works with a snug snap-on fit, so it&#8217;s easy to manually remove when necessary.While a clean cloth can pretty much clean the camera (or canned air works fine) a dust cover is always useful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1_camer_dust_cover.jpg"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1_camer_dust_cover.jpg" alt="PIMP MY FAB Assembly Instructions" width="625" height="437" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As some of the user reported smal particles of dust getting in to the left side panel from the endstop holes, we created a pair of clips that covers the area and limit the dust entrance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dust_lock_0.jpg"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/dust_lock_0.jpg" alt="PIMP MY FAB Assembly Instructions" width="625" height="381" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dust_lock.jpg"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Dust_lock.jpg" alt="PIMP MY FAB Assembly Instructions" width="625" height="341" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, an easy Spool lock-in place lever that is made to hold all spools close to 200x55mm in size <em>inside</em> the spool vane without the need of extended rollers (i.e. most of the suppliers today).<br />
just tilt the lever up and the spool will come off. gravity will hold the lever down and the spool in place during normal operations.<br />
<a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/spool_holder.jpg"><img class="img-responsive aligncenter" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/spool_holder.jpg" alt="spool_holder" width="474" height="301" /></a><br />
There are more parts available,like the spool rollers made by the community.<br />
Others will be added soon and be available for the community.<br />
You can find all FABtotum-related parts by surfing the <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/FABtotum/collections/replicable-addons" target="_blank">FABtotum Replicable Addons collection </a>on Thingiverse.</p>
