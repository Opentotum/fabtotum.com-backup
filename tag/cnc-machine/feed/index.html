<p>here we are again!<br />
Time for a second Community Highlight has come.<br />
As said in the <a href="https://www.fabtotum.com/fabtotums-community-highlights-multicolor-3d-printing/">previous post</a>, we are willing to let everyone see what a FABtotum lover can do!</p>
<p>Today we would like to introduce you our friend <strong>Alessio Cavalieri</strong>: he is well known on the forums already, and he likes to get his name clearly written where and when he makes something new. This is why his nickname is simply <a href="http://www.fabtotum.com/forums/user/alessio-cavalieri/">alessio.cavalieri</a>, easy right?<br />
He did many things along the time he has been a FABtotum owner. Today we&#8217;ll see how he created an <strong>Engraved Name Plate</strong> using the <strong>Milling Head</strong> (actually he used an old Hybrid one).</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116354" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cnc_milling_fabtotum_wooden_name_plate.jpg" alt="cnc_milling_fabtotum_wooden_name_plate" width="884" height="464" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cnc_milling_fabtotum_wooden_name_plate.jpg 884w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cnc_milling_fabtotum_wooden_name_plate-300x157.jpg 300w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cnc_milling_fabtotum_wooden_name_plate-768x403.jpg 768w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cnc_milling_fabtotum_wooden_name_plate-705x370.jpg 705w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cnc_milling_fabtotum_wooden_name_plate-450x236.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px" /></p>
<p><strong>How is it possible? Here is what he did, briefly.</strong><br />
The plate he used perfectly fitted in the FABtotum working area: a woodplate 200mm x 80mm. He started with some tests and tries on the designing side and finally got to the perfect version, which was then finally used as a gift. What a nice idea!<br />
Good tip: he used a plywood that gets a nice finishing thanks to the natural texture of the different layers. Wood&#8217;s grain of the various layers will contrast between them, with a nice optical effect. Compared to a standard wood block, you&#8217;ll get a better look with no additional stress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to get a proper file? Inkscape example</strong><br />
Well, there are many software you can use to create a project for your FABtotum. Alessio decided for Inkscape, a free one that can be used with any OS. Just use it to write or draw.<br />
Step by step, to get a doable object and a working file, he proceeded with writing the name, placed it on the surface and created the path. Here is how:<br />
1. Designed the plate and placed near the origins (lower left corner): this is important if the final part is not as big as the block you start from.<br />
2. Selected the text of the inscription and from menu: Path → Object to Path. The “Path” is what the CAM software will use as directions to move around and create.<br />
3. Saved the design using: Save as → Plain SVG</p>
<p><strong>How to create a GCODE with Makercam?</strong><br />
Alessio opted for Makercam, a free online tool (http://www.makercam.com/).<br />
Before you upload your svg file, check these settings:<br />
1. Set centimeters instead inches as default unit (if you&#8217;re fine with inches make sure to convert all the suggested values);<br />
2. Select Edit → Edit preferences Set → DPI to 90 (suggested to import a drawing from Inkscape, set 75 for Illustrator)<br />
<em>Now upload your SVG and turn into a GCODE:</em><br />
1. Open the plain SVG saved with Inkscape, make sure to delete any unwanted object;<br />
2. Select the inscription/draw you want to be engrave, it must be red;<br />
3. Select CAM → pocket operation, and add some settings:<br />
name: writehereyourfilename<br />
tool (mm): write here the diameter of your bit (Alessio set 1mm)<br />
target depth (mm): set how deep you want to mill (Alessio set 2 mm)<br />
safety height (mm): write here how much the Head should rise before spinning (Alessio set 10)<br />
step down (mm): how deep the mill should go at each pass (Alessio set 0.25)<br />
feedrate (mm/minute): movements speed (Alessio set 400)<br />
plunge rate (mm/minute): (Alessio set 100).</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to set the above settings for each part of the design: to do so, simply select the part (n°2) and start again with n°3. In Alessio&#8217;s one, for example, he then needed to set screw holes and outside shape. <a href="http://itink.it/wiki/doku.php?id=en:tinkering:cnc:woodnameplateformontessoribedgiulio">Read the whole article he published on his blog</a> or contact him if you want to know more!</p>
<p><em>Last part: get the GCODE saved properly:</em><br />
1. Select CAM → calculate all<br />
2. Select CAM → export gcode<br />
3. Select all calculated toolpaths, export and save the GCODE file on PC.</p>
<p>As a safer procedure, check if the FABtotum will be able to get your project done. Check the outer path: is it going to fit? If yes, go for it!</p>
<p><strong>Post processing the GCODE</strong><br />
Ok, one last step: as you will use the FABtotum, you&#8217;ll need the GCODE that Alessio set up for us (thanks!). It&#8217;s called <a href="https://github.com/alessiocavalieri/MakerCAM2FABtotum">MakerCAM2FABtotum</a>, it&#8217;s on GitHub. It is essential to make sure that your 3D printer knows you&#8217;re going to get her something different to bite than some good PLA. It&#8217;s a Linux bash script but you can run it also in Windows. Ask him if needed!<br />
Here is an example of what you can do:<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116350" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fabtotum-cam-gcode.png" alt="fabtotum-cam-gcode" width="706" height="61" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fabtotum-cam-gcode.png 706w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fabtotum-cam-gcode-300x26.png 300w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fabtotum-cam-gcode-705x61.png 705w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/fabtotum-cam-gcode-450x39.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px" /><br />
This will set the FABtotum&#8217;s Milling Head to spin at 12000RPM.<br />
Ok you&#8217;re done! Now get on the FABUI, open the Object manager and proceed just as you are used to.</p>
<p>Final tip: add an extra layer underneath your starting block if you have cutout parts so that neither the Hybrid Bed neither your milling bit will get damaged.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116359" src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/milling_with_fabtotum_wood_plate.jpg" alt="milling_with_fabtotum_wood_plate" width="341" height="164" srcset="https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/milling_with_fabtotum_wood_plate.jpg 341w, https://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/milling_with_fabtotum_wood_plate-300x144.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it looks like a long process and it might not be as easy as a sandcastle, but it looks great, right? Will you try yours? Do you have tips to get things done faster? We&#8217;d love to hear from you!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for this Community Highlight: thanks to Alessio.cavalieri once again, keep up the good job!</p>

<p>After a short break we are already back with some updates for you. Expect more in the near future, you&#8217;ll hear from us again really soon.<br />
In the meantime we can tell you that, after two years from the start and one of production/deliveries, we have a bunch of new things that will be available in the upcoming days.</p>
<p><strong>The Hybrid Head V2</strong><br />
We told you in the<a href="http://blog.fabtotum.com/blog/2015/07/21/fabtotum-is-getting-upgraded/" target="_blank"> previous post</a> that the Hybrid Head V2 is on its way: we&#8217;re not done yet with it though: we are still working on the last details; the final result will offer you the best performances ever and a better quality of prints.<br />
While waiting for some smaller parts to be delivered and tested, we are already watching it printing fine objects.<br />
In the picture below you can see some samples that show you the improvements: higher temperatures let us try different materials and we can proudly tell you we can print PLA, ABS and NYLON.</p>
<div style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter center"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_headv2-1024x683.jpg" alt="Samples of prints with the Hybrid Head V2" width="625" height="417" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><i>Samples of prints with the Hybrid Head V2</i></p></div>
<p>The specs are the ones previously released but we take the chance to sum them up:</p>
<ul>
<li>full metal body hotend;</li>
<li>improved fans system;</li>
<li>completely interchangeable nozzle (which means easier maintenance/replacing);</li>
<li>completely interchangeable cartridge;</li>
<li>different nozzle sizes available (we will tell you more later on);</li>
<li>260° max working temperature.</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/FABtotum_HHV2-1024x633.jpg" alt="First pictures of the Hybrid Head V2: final look may still change" width="625" height="386" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><i>First pictures of the Hybrid Head V2: final look may still change</i></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A new Feeder</strong><br />
The feeder mechanism has now become simpler and does not require any action to switch between additive and subtractive mode.<br />
No more buttons to be pushed: new FABtotums will have a slightly different feeder and won&#8217;t have any hole on the back inner panel.</p>
<p>What if you already have a FABtotum and want this to be available on yours as well?<br />
We will add a dedicated note on our wiki as you need to manually change it before switching to the new version from the settings of the FabUI.<br />
This is something we decided to change as a consequence of the community&#8217;s experience. That&#8217;s why, once again, we are always looking for your feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Scanning update</strong><br />
Out of the three first capabilities of the FABtotum, scanning option has always been difficult to be used. Results were not always reliable and satisfying. We worked hard on this as we wanted to offer you a better product. In the upcoming months we will focus even more to have you less stressed when postprocessing. Shapes will be less deformed, the camera is going to add colours and details to the final result. We will tell you more as soon as we have news and we will always update our <a href="http://forum.fabtotum.cc/forumdisplay.php?9-Development-Logs" target="_blank">development log on the forum</a> as well.</p>
<div style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/spil-m.jpg" alt="Developing the scanner results" width="625" height="460" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><i>Developing the scanner results</i></p></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A more complete Wiki</strong><br />
First year of FABtotum&#8217;s life also gave us a better idea of which were the main obstacles between a bad print and a good one: 3d printing can require a bit of knowledge first and our machine as well need to be “discovered”.</p>
<p>To help you (and to help us as well) we are little by little completing the wiki: a lot of new contents have been added every now and then and still are. Our Team together with the community increased the literature available online so that troubleshooting and first steps became easier.<br />
<a href="http://wiki.fabtotum.com/doku.php?id=start" target="_blank">You can give it a look and find out yourself here</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fabtotum_assembly-1024x480.png" alt="An idea of all the components of the FABtotum" width="625" height="293" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><i>An idea of all the components of the FABtotum</i></p></div>
<p><strong>All the documents are now on GitHub</strong><br />
We have gone even further than that: loyal to our Open Source identity, on Git Hub we added every missing specification. From hardware (<a href="https://grabcad.com/library/fabtotum-2" target="_blank">already available on GrabCAD</a>) to software, everyone can see what the FABtotum is made of and how it works. Suggestions are appreciated, simple curiosity is also welcome.<br />
<a href="http://wiki.fabtotum.com/doku.php?id=open_source" target="_blank">Here is where you can find everything</a></p>
<p><strong>Laser Head</strong><br />
It has been in our projects since the beginning and it is now pretty much ready. We are still testing it, but the first results have seen our smiles rising and shining on our faces. It is not mentioned to cut hard and thick materials: we still prefer to leave this kind of job to the milling motor. Now you can throw away that smelly mutated seabass of yours.<br />
With the laser head of the FABtotum you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>engrave woods, plastics etc;</li>
<li>cut thin sheets of paper, cardboard and plastic.</li>
</ul>
<p>You cannot:</p>
<ul>
<li>cut thick plastics or other thick materials (&gt;0.2mm)</li>
<li>pretend to be an evil scientist.</li>
</ul>
<div style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/laser_rid-e1439981003659.png" alt="Testing the laser precision and quality" width="625" height="356" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><i>Testing the laser precision and quality</i></p></div>
<p>The new head won&#8217;t replicate the capability of the milling head. However, as you may know, laser engraving has a much more higher precision. You will be able to write or draw lines on the mentioned materials, as well as cut what would be too soft of thin for a drill bit.<br />
The power of the laser we will use is <strong>500 mW</strong>: nothing too powerful, just enough to do what&#8217;s needed.<br />
This means that it won&#8217;t be too dangerous or require special equipments, but it will still be better to use a bit of extra care when turned on.<br />
This is how it will look like, more or less:</p>
<div style="width: 635px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="img-responsive " src="http://www.fabtotum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_4465_laser-rid.jpg" alt="First pictures of the Laser Head - final look may be slightly different" width="625" height="417" /><p class="wp-caption-text"><i> First pictures of the Laser Head &#8211; final look may be slightly different</i></p></div>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><br />
</em>It will be easy to be mounted on the FABtotum and won&#8217;t require extra calibrations in addition to the ones you would normally do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Coming soon&#8230;</strong><br />
Today, then, we can say we already pushed the envelope a bit further than the first idea of FABtotum, born two years ago on Indiegogo.</p>

<p>But, as said at the very beginning of this post, we still have other great news coming soon&#8230;</p>
